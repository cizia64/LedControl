# LedControl
Led Control app for TrimUI Brick (It's been reported on reddit that it works with Smart pro too)    
Works with Stock OS and Stockmix, might work with others but not tested

# Installation
You can download the latest version of the Led Control app from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ro8inmorgan/LedControl/releases). 

Stock/StockMix/Crossmix:
Just unzip and copy the LedControl folder from the OtherOS folder to the Apps folder on your SD Card, then bootup your TrimUI Brick and the Led Control app will be available in the Apps menu.

MinUI:
Copy the LedControl.pak folder from the MinUI folder to the Tools/tg3040/ folder on your SD card, reboot your brick and app should be available in the Tools section

# Instructions
L&R buttons to switch between lights
D-pad up/down to select the setting and left/right to adjust its value   

B Button to quit the application   
Please quit the app using the B button and not by holding the power button as that will also stop the Led Control background process

# Important notes
This is an initial first version I just wanted to get this out to you guys quickly so I still have to fix some things but please note the following
- After completely turning off your TrimUI Brick (not standby), the Led Control app needs to be started again. 
- Brightness can be controlled in the TrimUI display settings
   
# TODO:
- Implementing auto start after cold boot
- Create version for Knulli
- If possible maybe ambilight function, need to test if I can access the screen buffer
- Brightness control in the app itself instead of using settings for this, for ease of use
- General improvements of UI
