# LedControl
Led Control app for TrimUI Brick (It's been reported on reddit that it works with Smart pro too)    
Works with Stock OS (Mix, cross etc) and MinUI. Might work with Knulli too but not tested

# Installation
You can download the latest version of the Led Control app from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ro8inmorgan/LedControl/releases). 

Stock/StockMix/Crossmix:   
Just unzip and copy the LedControl.pak folder to the Apps folder on your SD Card, then bootup your TrimUI Brick and the Led Control app will be available in the Apps menu.

MinUI:   
Copy the LedControl.pak folder Tools/tg3040/ folder on your SD card, reboot your brick and app should be available in the Tools section
   
# Instructions
L&R buttons to switch between lights
D-pad up/down to select the setting and left/right to adjust its value   

B Button to quit the application   
Please quit the app using the B button and not by holding the power button as that will also stop the Led Control background process
   
# Uninstall
Use the seperate included LCRemove.pak app, copy it to your SD card same way, run the app and reboot. Leds will be restored to default functions. If you run Led Control app it will install again
