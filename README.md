# LedControl
Led Control app for TrimUI Brick
   
Just unzip and copy the LedControl folder to the Apps folder on your SD Card, then bootup your TrimUI Brick and the Led Control app will be available in the Apps menu.
   
After completely turning off your TrimUI Brick (not standby), the Led Control app needs to be started again. 
   
L&R buttons are used to switch between lights: function button1 (f1), functionn button2 (f2), top light (m), triggers (lr)
